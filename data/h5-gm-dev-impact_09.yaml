- en: 'If you want to build a game to make some money, it is imperative you take a
    few things into consideration before starting off building one. The first question
    you will need to ask yourself is probably this: who am I going to build a game
    for? Are you aiming at everyone capable of playing games or do you want to target
    a very specific segment of people and meet their gaming needs? This is the difference
    between broad and niche targeting. An example of very broadly targeted games are
    most tower defense games, in which you need to build towers with diverse properties
    to repel an army. Games such as Tetris, Bejeweled , Minesweeper , and most light
    puzzle games in general. Angry Birds is another example of a game that is popular
    with a broad audience because of its simplicity, likeable graphics, and incredible
    amount of clever marketing.'

- en: The main advantage to building casual games is that practically everyone is
    a potential user of your game. As such, the achievable success can be enormous.
    World of Warcraft is a game which has moved from rather hardcore and niche to
    more casual over the years. They did this because they had already reached most
    regular gamers out there, and decided to convince the masses that you can play
    World of Warcraft even if you don't play a lot in general. The downside of trying
    to please everyone is the amount of competition. Sticking out as a unique game
    among numerous games out there is tremendously difficult. This is especially true
    if you don't have an impressive marketing machine to back it up.

    Trek , Star Wars , Lord of the Rings , and so on, are mostly aimed at people who

    targeted solely at a specific group of gamers. For example, people who prefer
    playing FPS (First Person Shooters) games, and do so every single day. In essence,

    prefer it over all the others?

  zh: 然而，不要混淆。霰弹枪策略并不是建造平庸游戏的借口。你发布的每款游戏都应该有独特的特色——没有其他游戏有的东西。如果一个游戏没有新的特色，为什么有人会选择它而不是其他所有游戏呢？
- en: Then, of course, there is the sniper strategy, which involves building a decent
    and well-thought-out game and releasing it to the market with the utmost care
    and support. This is what distributors such as Apple urge developers to do, and
    for good reason—you wouldn't want your app store full of crappy games, would you?
    Some other game distributers, such as Steam, are even pickier in the games they
    allow to be distributed, making the shotgun strategy nearly impossible. But it
    is also the strategy most successful game developers use. Take a look at developers
    such as Rockstar (developer of the GTA series), Besthesda (developer of the Elder
    Scroll series), Bioware (developer of the Mass Effect series), Blizzard (developer
    of the Warcraft series), and many others. These are no small fries, yet they don't
    have that many games on the market. This tactic of developing high quality games
    and hoping they will pay off is obviously not without risk. In order to develop
    a truly amazing game, you also need the time and money to do so. If your game
    fails to sell, this can be a real problem for you or your company. Even for HTML5
    games, this can be the case, especially since devices and browsers keep getting
    more and more powerful. When the machines running the games get more powerful,
    the games themselves often become more complex and take longer to develop.

  zh: 当然，还有狙击策略，它涉及构建一个体面且经过深思熟虑的游戏，并在市场上以最大的关怀和支持发布。这是苹果等分发商敦促开发者做的事情，也是有充分理由的——你不希望你的应用商店里充斥着糟糕的游戏，对吧？一些其他游戏分发商，比如Steam，在允许分发的游戏方面更加挑剔，使得散弹策略几乎不可能。但这也是最成功的游戏开发者使用的策略。看看Rockstar（GTA系列的开发者）、Besthesda（上古卷轴系列的开发者）、Bioware（质量效应系列的开发者）、暴雪（魔兽世界系列的开发者）等开发者。这些都不是小角色，但他们在市场上的游戏并不多。开发高质量游戏并希望它们能够成功显然是有风险的。为了开发一个真正了不起的游戏，你还需要时间和金钱。如果你的游戏销售不佳，这对你或你的公司来说可能是一个真正的问题。即使对于HTML5游戏来说，情况也可能如此，特别是因为设备和浏览器变得越来越强大。当运行游戏的设备变得更强大时，游戏本身通常会变得更加复杂，开发时间也会更长。

    noticing about the Chrome Store is the one-time $5 entrance fee for posting apps.
    If this in itself is not good enough, the transaction fee for selling an app is
    only 5 percent. This is a remarkable difference to both Google Play and the iOS
    App Store. If you are already developing a game for your own website and packaged
    it as an app for Android and/or Apple, you can just as well launch it on the Chrome
    Web Store. Turning your ImpactJS game into a web app for the Chrome Store can
    be done using AppMobi, yet Google itself provides detailed documentation on how

    Play和iOS应用商店有着显著的不同。如果你已经为自己的网站开发了一款游戏，并将其打包为安卓和/或苹果的应用，你也可以在Chrome网络商店上发布。将你的ImpactJS游戏转换为Chrome商店的网络应用可以使用AppMobi，但Google本身提供了如何手动操作的详细文档。

    version for a price. The Smurfs game also uses the freemium model, albeit with
    a difference. The entire game is free, but players can opt to pay real money to
    buy things that would otherwise cost them a lot of time to acquire. In this freemium
    model, you pay for convenience and unique items. For instance, in PlanetSide 2,
    acquiring a certain sniper rifle might take you several days or $10, depending

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter we have taken a look at some important elements while considering
    your game development strategy. Do you wish to adapt a shotgun approach and develop
    a lot of games in a short time span? Or will you use the sniper strategy and only
    build a few, but very polished games? You also need to decide upon the audience
    you wish to reach out to with your game. You have the option of building a game
    that is liked by everyone, but the competition is steep.

  zh: 在本章中，我们已经看了一些重要的元素，考虑了你的游戏开发策略。你想采取散弹枪策略，在短时间内开发大量游戏吗？还是你会使用狙击手策略，只开发一些精心制作的游戏？你还需要决定你希望吸引的受众群体。你可以选择制作一款受到所有人喜爱的游戏，但竞争激烈。

    there are registration fees. If you decide to develop apps, it is worth giving
    the Chrome Web Store a try (it runs web apps).

- en: In-game advertising is another way to fund your efforts, though most companies
    offering this service for online games have high prerequisites and support Flash
    games more than they do the newer HTML5 games.

  zh: 游戏内广告是资助你的努力的另一种方式，尽管大多数提供在线游戏服务的公司对此有很高的先决条件，并且更多地支持Flash游戏而不是更新的HTML5游戏。
- en: One of the most promising of monetization schemes is the freemium model. Players
    are allowed to freely play your game but they pay real money for extras. This
    is an easily tolerated model since the game is essentially free to play for anyone
    not willing to spend money, and no annoying advertising is present either.

  zh: 最有前途的变现模式之一是免费模式。玩家可以自由玩游戏，但他们需要为额外的内容付费。这是一个容易被接受的模式，因为对于不愿意花钱的人来说，游戏基本上是免费的，而且也没有烦人的广告。
- en: 'A combination of in-game advertising and freemium is possible as well: people
    annoyed by the advertising pay a fee and in return they are not bothered by it
    anymore.'

  zh: 游戏内广告和免费模式的组合也是可能的：被广告打扰的人支付费用，作为回报，他们将不再受到打扰。
- en: A final option is leaving the marketing aspect to someone else by selling your
    distribution rights with the help of MarketJS. They aim for HTML5 games and this
    option is especially useful for the beginner game developer who has difficulty
    in marketing his or her game.

- en: We have now reached the end of the book and quite a lot of information has been
    covered – from the basics of setting up your server, over the development of an
    ImpactJS game, and to the distribution of your own creation. I thank you for reading
    all of this.

- en: 'My hope was to make this entire process a bit more graspable and deliver the
    final push for you to start creating your own games and maybe even make a living
    out of it. Sometimes, developing a game can be frustrating, as the devil is often
    in the detail. You might find yourself cursing your screen more often than you
    like, but remember that it''s not the computer''s fault, and with enough determination
    you will always find a solution. If you find yourself lost at times, the ImpactJS
    website has a great forum full of very helpful people and I would greatly encourage
    you to make use of it and share your thoughts, questions, and ideas there. When
    you close this book and start building your game, don''t forget that having a
    plan and working in a very structured way will be the key elements to success
    and might prevent many sleepless nights. Making changes and improvements in a
    step-by-step manner and always checking if everything still works as intended
    is the way to go and deliver a perfectly functioning game. But regardless of all
    the benefits that can be reaped from organized and structured thinking, there
    lies another most important thing: your imagination.'

  zh: 我希望能让整个过程更容易理解，并为你开始创作自己的游戏甚至可能靠此谋生提供最后的推动。有时，开发游戏可能会令人沮丧，因为魔鬼常常隐藏在细节中。你可能会发现自己经常咒骂屏幕，但请记住这不是电脑的错，只要有足够的决心，你总能找到解决方案。如果你有时感到迷茫，ImpactJS网站有一个充满了非常乐于助人的人的论坛，我非常鼓励你利用它，在那里分享你的想法、问题和想法。当你关闭这本书，开始制作你的游戏时，不要忘记制定计划并以非常有条理的方式工作将是成功的关键因素，并可能避免许多不眠之夜。逐步进行变更和改进，并始终检查一切是否仍然按预期运行是正确的方式，可以交付一个完美运行的游戏。但是，尽管有组织和有条理的思维所带来的所有好处，还有另一个最重要的东西：你的想象力。
- en: Think original, don't be bound by what is already out there, and you will no
    doubt create a game that millions of people might enjoy and, who knows, will even
    stand the test of time.
