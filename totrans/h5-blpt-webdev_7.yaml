    minimize all our scripts and optimize the images, so that these pages load as
    quickly as possible anywhere in the world. We can automate these tasks by executing
    a script on the command line. Let us look at the options we have.

- en: Once you are done with your project, you would like to generate files that strip
    comments and are optimized for loading quickly. There are software build systems
    that are typically used in software projects with similar goals. HTML5 Boilerplate's
    build scripts provide tasks scoped to what a typical web development project would
    need.

- en: The script should be used only after you have confirmed your project is ready
    for deployment and it has been well tested. The build script merely automates
    the process of removing comments, optimizing files, and making sure the files

- en: It is fairly trivial to initialize an HTML5 Boilerplate project with Node build
    script and then convert it into a template you are building for Drupal or WordPress.
    First, make sure you choose the `Custom` option when executing `h5bp init`. Then,
    when setting the folders, set `inc` as the folder where your stylesheet will be,
    and `images` as the name of the folder that would contain your template images.
    When you are prompted again, enter in the same values and the project framework
    will be generated for you. Make sure you replace `index.html` with your template
    files.

    from the HTML5 Boilerplate team. We also looked at how we can use them both with
    Drupal or WordPress templates. We also looked at what we can do once the files
    have been built.
